    <p>
        Prepare a case for sentence is a new digital service for probation practitioners and administrators in
        magistratesâ€™ courts.
        <br />
        The service provides an overview of all defendants attending court on a given day including their probation
        status, probation record and risk information.
        <br />
        By providing this information in a more accessible and usable format, staff will be able to prepare for court
        more effectively and provide better advice with less effort.
